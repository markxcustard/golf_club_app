A radical departure from traditional driver-face design, Twist Face is engineered to take you farther and straighter… right down the center of the fairway.

Twist Face presents a revolutionary new face curvature with a corrective face angle on off-center hits, engineered to reduce side spin and deliver straighter shots. By providing more loft in the high-toe and less loft in the low-heel, this groundbreaking technology produces more consistent side spin in the areas where golfers commonly mis-hit.", photo: "https://www.taylormadegolf.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-tmag-master-catalog/default/v1526285561815/zoom/WZ617_zoom_D.jpg", price: "$399.99")

TaylorMade’s new Hammerhead slot creates a massive sweet spot that pushes the limit of ballspeed to produce distance and forgiveness across the entire face.

The reinforced outer portions of the slot allow for a lighter, more flexible face, while the center portion of the slot increases ballspeed on low-face strikes and drops spin for more distance. The result is a powerful and forgiving driver that delivers exceptional sound and feel.", photo: "https://www.taylormadegolf.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-tmag-master-catalog/default/v1526285561815/zoom/WZ625_zoom_D.jpg", price: "$429.99")

The idea is that by stiffening the body, more energy is transferred into the flexing of the face and thus, in turn, to propelling the ball forward.
